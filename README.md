### Transport for London Unified API

```
I wrote this overview of the TfL API as part of a Cherry Leaf API documentation course.
```

The Unified API provides real-time, high-volume, and accurate travel data across all transport modes within TfL and other transport authorities.
The API is now easier to use. Instead of providing different data formats for each transport mode, the API data is now uniform letting you: 
- Create once and maintain less.
- Automatically integrate API data into your databases.
- Keep your applications running and compatible even if source data changes.
The API is free and open to use in new ways if you follow the TfL data terms and conditions. 
We encourage you to use the Unified API instead of old data feeds. These feeds will be phased out once they are fully available in the Unified API.

### Use Cases
Using this API, you can:
- Compile accident details for a specified year.
- Get air quality data.
- Plan a journey across TfL using various transport lines and service types while getting real-time alerts about line or road disruptions, delays, and planned works.
- Calculate fares.
- Search bike points and occupancy, taxi and minicab information, and available facilities.
- Obtain real-time transport timetables and fixed bus schedules.
- Predict arrivals for all stops in each transport mode.
- Check availability of car and bike parking, and charge connectors.

### Base URL
All endpoints referenced below have the following base.
```
[https://api.tfl.gov.uk](mailto:https://api.tfl.gov.uk)

### Getting an API key
Sign up for an Application ID and Key at [https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/signup](mailto:https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/signup). Add the app_id and app_key query parameters to your requests.

### API reference guide
Browse and try the endpoints using Swagger UI our build it yourself from this Swagger File.

### Rate Limits
You're allowed a maximum of 300 calls per minute per data feed. Then, we'll limit access to the API to prevent slowing down the overall service.
